# 🎓 Brightspace Marks Updater 😄😄😄😄

*A tiny tool that makes grading less annoying.*

---

## What is this?
A small fun project I built to simplify updating student marks on Brightspace.

Instead of entering grades one by one, this tool lets me:
- Upload marks
- Save them locally
- Verify everything
- Publish all grades at once

No more panic publishes. No more clicking forever.

---

## Why it exists
Because:
- Manual grading is boring  
- Mistakes happen when you rush  
- Brightspace doesn’t ask “are you **really** sure?”  

This adds a simple **verify → publish** step.

---

## How it works (very high level)
1. Load marks  
2. Save them  
3. Verify them  
4. Push everything to Brightspace  
5. Relax 😄

---

## What it’s good at
- Batch grade updates  
- Preventing accidental publishes  
- Reducing human error  
- Saving time (and patience)

---

## What it is not
- An official Brightspace integration  
- A production-grade system  
- Something meant for public deployment

---

## Final note
Built for fun.  
Used for real.  
Grading is now slightly less painful.
